            <h2>Site Name: <span id="left-pink">Brain</span><span id="right-green">Cents</span></h2>

        </div>
        <p>I've chosen this as my site name because it describes the subject matter/purpose of the site in a concise
            way--brain having to do with the knowledge/information the site aims to communicate, and "cents" conveying
            that it is centered around money, or finances.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site will be designed to help users become better-informed and equipped to make critical financial
            decisions in their lives, like how to save for retirement by selecting an account type and simulating the
            likely wealth-building outcome of any given amount of regular contribution over any specified period of
            time; or how to get out of debt and generating a schedule for doing so via the snowball method. The site
            will use both informative and tool-based means to help the user become comfortable and confident in moving
            forward towards freedom from debt and effective retirement saving, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How quickly could I pay off all of my debt if I currently have $250 per month available for extra
                payments? What will the timeline of the process look like, and what's the best approach that will help
                me stay motivated?</li>
            <li>If I'm 33 years old and have not started saving for retirement yet, what are the most important things I
                should know as I'm getting started? How much should I contribute annually if I want to have $600,000
                available in retirement savings by the age of 65?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The color palette to be used for the site is as listed below, and as seen on this site plan document:</p>
        <ul id="palette-list">
            <li class="_F17C76">#F17C76, a muted pink/red, to be used for buttons, header background color, tagline
                text, etc. as an
                accent color.</li>
            <li class="_9CD85C">#9CD85C, a muted green, to be used for buttons, tagline text, highlights, etc.
                as an additional
                accent color.</li>
            <li class="_FCFCFC">#FCFCFC, an essentially white color to be used as the background, as well as a text
                color
                within the
                header/navigation menu as needed for contrast to greens/pinks.</li>
            <li class="_E8E8E8">#E8E8E8, a light gray to be used for thin line separators between sections and as an
                alternative contrast to black text.</li>
            <li class="_798DA3">#798DA3, a dark gray for non-header/less-emphasized text.</li>
            <li class="_2A2A2A">#2A2A2A, a black to be used for the color of text.</li>
            <li class="_E04444">#E04444, a stronger pink to be used for when the user hovers over a muted pink button.
            </li>
            <li class="_58A021">#58A021, a stronger green to be used for when the user hovers over a muted green button.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Two fonts will be used on the site--both are seen being generally used for their corresponding purposes on
            this site plan
            document.</p>
        <ul id="font-list">
            <li><span id="eb-garamond-span">EB Garamond</span>, used for the logo text, section headings, and the
                "tagline" of the site to
                communicate wisdom/professionalism.</li>
            <li><span id="open-sans-span">Open Sans</span>, used everywhere else for a more modern, readable look in
                contrast to the other
                font.</li>
        </ul>
