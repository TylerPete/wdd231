        <h2>Site Name: BrainCents </h2>
        <p>I've chosen this as my site name because .</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site will be designed to help users become better-informed and equipped to make critical financial
            decisions in their lives, like how to save for retirement by selecting an account type and simulating the
            likely wealth-building outcome of any given amount of regular contribution over any specified period of
            time; or how to get out of debt and generating a schedule for doing so via the snowball method. The site
            will use both informative and tool-based means to help the user become comfortable and confident in moving
            forward towards freedom from debt and effective retirement saving, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How quickly could I pay off all of my debt if I currently have $250 per month available for extra
                payments? What will the timeline of the process look like, and what's the best approach that will help
                me stay motivated?</li>
            <li>If I'm 33 years old and have not started saving for retirement yet, what are the most important things I
                should know as I'm getting started? How much should I contribute annually if I want to have $600,000
                available in retirement savings by the age of 65?</li>
        </ul>
