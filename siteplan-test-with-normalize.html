        <h2>Site Name: Pokemon Type Matchup Tool </h2>
        <p>I've chosen this as my site name because it is a fairly concise and accurate description of what the site is
            designed to be used for as a tool--evaluating advantageous Pokemon type matchups.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site provides helpful information for fans of the Pokemon franchise about the advantages/disadvantages of
            any given type mathcup through an interactive chart, along with a type effectiveness calculator.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Which types of Pokemon will my psychic-type attack be super-effective against?</li>
            <li>Do my Pokemon have any types of moves that will deal super-effective damage to my Steel/Dark-type
                opponent?</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The color palette to be used for the site is as listed below, and as seen on this site plan document:</p>
        <ul id="palette-list">
            <li>A <span id="blue">blue</span> to be used for the header/footer background color, and accents throughout
                (such as border colors): #4464a4</li>
            <li>A <span id="cream">cream</span> color to be used as the background color for standalone section or div
                elements such as the one containing this list, as well as the text color for page headers/footers:
                #F2ECE6</li>
            <li>A <span id="red">red</span> color to be used as an accent/spacer color below the header and in other
                small instances on a page: #BF3D3D</li>
            <li>A <span id="black">slightly bluish off-black</span> as the main text color throughout the site: #0F1A2A
            <li>A standard <span id="white">white</span> for the background color of the overall site: #ffffff;</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Two fonts will be used on the site--both are seen used for their corresponding purposes on this site plan
            document.</p>
        <ul id="font-list">
            <li>The font used for heading elements h1, h2, etc. is called "Lato" and will be accessed via a link
                element to Google Fonts in the head of the document.</li>
            <li>The font used for other text on the site is called "Pokemon B/W" and is a locally downloaded font that
                is declared using a CSS font-face rule. It is licensed under a "Creative Commons Attribution License",
                and therefore its creator will be credited on the site.</li>
        </ul>
